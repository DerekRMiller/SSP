## General Usage 

why do we need another midi input object when we have MIDI...

I'm glad you asked ;)

Currently the MIDI module is fixed to using the first midi device connected.

MTIN allows you to assign any connected midi input

Slew CC , this allows the incoming CC (7bit) messages to be slew a bit, useful if you want to use with audio signals.
the midi input device and channel is select in the system view (Left Shift+Right Shift)


## Limitation

generally midi is processed at 'control rate', so once per audio buffer.
however, the processing of midi is external to the audio host, so it is not intended to be 100% precise.
do not expect sample accuracy!

(though slew is done over one buffer)

## Tips

v/oct takes into account pitch bend, using the pitch bend range.
(you can set this to zero if you do not want pitchbends)

since this is MONOPHONIC, note behaviour is legato.

so if you play one note, then play another ..
the pitch will change and gate will go high, new velocity (as expected
you will then get a gate off ONLY when this last note is released
not the first note.

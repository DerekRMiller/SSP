## General Usage 

This module allows output of midi notes and cc to a selected device.
the midi output device and channel is select in the system view (Left Shift+Right Shift)
hint: if OMNI is selected for channel, it will use channel 1


## Limitations

do NOT use at audio rate, you'll almost certainly overrun a buffer, either on the ssp or your midi router/device ;)

the SSP currently has an issue where it internally connects to the output device that is created  (argghh!)
this means the MIDI module will cease to work.
ALSO if you attempt to switch patches, you will get an ERROR
the 'workaround' to this is before you switch patches is to reconnect a physical midi device to get the SSP to connect to that!

I will be letting Percussa know of this issue, and hopefully a new release can fix this.


## Tips
if a pitchbend range is specified then if the v/oct changes whilst the gate is high
pitchbends will be output to keep achieve the note. of course, this is only within the pitchbend range.
set a pitchbend range appropriately.
sub tip: small pitchbend ranges have more resolution, but (duh) less range.

new notes sent on gate change

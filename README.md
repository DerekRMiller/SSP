#SSP Repo

repo containing TheTechnobear VSTs for SSP


## Releases
I release all of these (free) plugins via the Percussa Forum

for news, please consult this thread
https://forum.percussa.com/t/thetechnobears-vsts-development/941

If you like what I do, please consider making a donation via my ko-fi page.

thru ko-fi, I also sometimes give "Early Access" to plugins whilst I am developing them :) 



## Building
all the source code I use to build these plug-ins is provided in this repo.
there is a BUILDING document in the docs directory to give some information about this process. please read this! 

**however** , I do this in my free time, I do not have the spare time to provide developer support, so I assume if you want to build - you will know how to figure out things like dependancies. 

therefore I do NOT recommend building these plugins, unless you are an experienced developer and have a purpose.. thats why I release the binaries :) 


## Support
If you have any issues/bugs with the plugins, please use the percussa forum to report.

Again, due to limited time - I cannot at this time provide developer support, on how/why plugins are written as they are, or how you could re-use my code. the code is the documentation ;) 


## Directories

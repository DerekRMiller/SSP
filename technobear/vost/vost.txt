## General Usage 

the voltage store is a module which stores voltages :) 


there are 16 voltages, contained in 10 layers.

the select parameter (and cv) determines which layers voltages are used.


these voltages are used as Attenuverters to the signal inputs.
the signal inputs are normalised to 1.0 (aka 5v)


When the Morph parameter is OFF, then the 'closest' layers voltages are uses, and so the voltages are 'stepped'
When the Morph parameter is ON, then linear interpolation is used between the layers voltages.

The slew parameter adds a slight slew as the voltages are changes.
it does NOT slew the input signal, just the layer voltages, it slews teh same regardless of Morph.



Note: the Select CV is an offset to the select parameter where 1 = all layers (so 10), -1 = -10 and is added to the select paramters
this means 0.1 = 1 layer, 0.2 = 2 layers etc.



## Usages

some ideas... and what Ive been using it for ;) 

#### Preset CV
you can use the 16 voltages for 'preset' values for other module parameters, the layers can then be used to select between different preset valuess
advanced usage: the preset can be attenuating modulate e.g. feed an LFO into the SIG A, then the preset selects amound of modulation.

morph and slew can be useful in different parameters


#### Mixing
the signal are audio rate, so the different layers can be used for different levels.
(you will want slew on for this, so soften the changes) 


#### Sequencing
if you send send in ramp to select CV, it will move thru the layers , where by sequencing 10 steps.


#### extra hint
you may want to consider how you can use Vost with matrix mixer and matrix switch ;) 




## Limitations
Select Offset is at 'control rate', not audio rate - im not sure we need at audio rate(?)

slew is global, not per voltage - of course, you can use many VOSTs in your patch.


slew rate is currently fixed

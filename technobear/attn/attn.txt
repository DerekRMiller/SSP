## General Usage 

a very simple attenuator modulator with 16 inputs.

why does it exist since, we already can attenuate both inputs and outputs.

well it has 3 nice features:

a) an unconnected input is normalled to 1.0 (or 5v)  - this means, the sliders act at a value

b) slewed values - you can optionally slew parameter changes

c) midi learn - since its a technobear VST the sliders can all be assigned directly to midi controllers.
hint: this is why the slew exists ;)


combined the general purpose is as a useful module to allow CV that is an assigned to an external controller, and changed via midi.

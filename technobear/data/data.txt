## General Usage 

Data is inspired by a modern digital oscilliscope which have the capabilities not only to view traces
but also to give us information about the input signals.

We have 4 input signals (A-D), that can be audio or CV.

There are 4 ways of display 
Main Scope - shows all 4 traces, which can be turned on/off and scale/offset

X/Y scope - takes 2 signals, first is used to X, second is used for Y.

Mini Scope - a smaller verison of the main scope showing 2 channels.


Data - displays min/max/average of the display scope in volts
Note is the v/oct value of average  - designed for CV, it is NOT pitch detection/tuning!

the current UI will display the Data at all times.
then a combination of either the Main Scope , or a pair of X/Y scope or Mini scope.



## Future plans
I've lots of ideas for this plug-in, we could do things like spectrum analyser.
also I'd like to have a function to allow user to select areas and get data readouts to compare values.



## Tips

- unconnected inputs
will not appear on main scope.

- scale/offset 
using scale and offset, we can place different traces above/below each other.
scale/offset are only used on main scope - x/y and mini scopes are unaffected.


- outputs
for ease of use, the input signals are reflected to the output, this allows for patching 'inline'.
it should be noted, as with all SSP modules this may include a 1 buffer delay of the signal.

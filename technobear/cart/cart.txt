## General Usage
This module is inspired by Rene from Make Noise.



# Future Ideas

Rene 2 introduced the Z plane, which is 64 stores states or x/y/c
with ability to copy between them, and also move thru by cv.
I have to figure out parameter control for this, since it would introduce too many parameters
to have all planes as vst parameters
I guess, I'll make the parameters represent the 'current plane' - then persist these to others layers

# dev notes

## milestones/stages

- get fundamental sequencing with generic params
really basic ui, with simple seq functionality incl, diff snakes/ x/y/c, access


- start consider final ui
how would it extend to fuller functionality
more advanced sequencing functionality
decide scope of v1, and what can slip

- quant/glide?
quantizer - free quantizer
also has range of output - 1, 2, 3, or 4 octave
no-octave = unquantised

glide is fixed, and proportional to clk speed

- mod functionality
see fun.mod

- check rene functionality
look to see whats missing, and what we might want
- not going to implement Z for now


fun.op
- none?
- sleep - access skip, or stay but dont fire gate
- trig - off = trig length = clk length, on= short trig
- scan - scans all knobs, copy to current channel

fun.mod - how to use mod signal
reset - reset to first position, that is access ON
clk - combines clk + mod, allows retrig
runstp - runs on high mod
dir  - fwd/reverse

fun.cv - how to use cv signal
add - add to cv values (pre quant), not c
loc - location
snake - use for snake
s&h - same as cv/add but only change on rising edge of mod

# dev todo / reminders

## editor - layer params
glide, quant, snake, fun

## editor - general display?
use param bar, or move to something more unique?

## x/y/z mod and cv

check functionality
        I_X_CLK,
        I_X_MOD,
        I_X_CV,
        I_Y_CLK,
        I_Y_MOD,
        I_Y_CV,
        I_Z_MOD,
        I_Z_CV,

some of these are 'fun' modes?


things to implement/check...

## layer :: glide
glide is on all layers, for CV only
do we need glide time?

## layer :: snake
determines routing (findnextstep)

## layer :: fun
check functionality !

## layer :: quant
how do we want this , fixed scales, or like Rene?

## step cv
affected by glide, quant

## step access
changes find next pos
... is this always skip?
I think there is a function to just suppress gate
and so keep time? double check!

## step gate
do we need gate time?

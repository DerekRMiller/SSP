# dev notes

## milestones/stages

- get fundamental sequencing with generic params
really basic ui, with simple seq functionality incl, diff snakes/ x/y/c, access

- start consider final ui
how would it extend to fuller functionality
more advanced sequencing functionality
decide scope of v1, and what can slip

- quant/glide?

- mod functionality (!)

- check rene functionality
look to see whats missing, and what we might want


---------

# dev todo / reminders

## editor - layer params
glide, quant, snake, fun

## editor - general display?
use param bar, or move to something more unique?

## x/y/z mod and cv

check functionality
        I_X_CLK,
        I_X_MOD,
        I_X_CV,
        I_Y_CLK,
        I_Y_MOD,
        I_Y_CV,
        I_Z_MOD,
        I_Z_CV,

some of these are 'fun' modes?


things to implement/check...

## layer :: glide
glide is on all layers, for CV only
do we need glide time?

## layer :: snake
determines routing (findnextstep)

## layer :: fun
check functionality !

## layer :: quant
how do we want this , fixed scales, or like Rene?

## step cv
affected by glide, quant

## step access
changes find next pos
... is this always skip?
I think there is a function to just suppress gate
and so keep time? double check!

## step gate
do we need gate time?

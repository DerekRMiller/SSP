## General Usage 

The primary purpose of this module is to 'trigger' actions based on a specific note.

this module provide 8 trigger, which can be any note number (defaults to C4-G8 =midi note 60-57).
when it receives this note, it generates a short trigger (64 samples ~1ms @ 48k sr), and then falls.
note: its a trig NOT gate, so ignore note off.

also velocity is reported during the trig, this is intended to be used as for 'accent' purposes.
(though of course you are free to use it for whatever you wish :) ) 


## Limitation

generally midi is processed at 'control rate', so once per audio buffer.
however, the processing of midi is external to the audio host, so it is not intended to be 100% precise.
do not expect sample accuracy!


only one trig per audio buffer is currently supported, so around 2.6ms @ 48k sr
